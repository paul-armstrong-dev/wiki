<h2 id="hadoop-vs-spark">Hadoop vs Spark</h2>
<h4 id="hadoop">Hadoop</h4>
<p><strong>Hadoop is an open-source framework that allows to store and process big data, in a distributed environment across clusters of computers.</strong> 
- Hadoop is designed to scale up from a single server to thousands of machines, where every machine is offering local computation and storage. 
- Hadoop is a registered trademark of the Apache software foundation. 
- It utilizes a simple programming model to perform the required operation among clusters. 
- All modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures are common occurrences and should be dealt with by the framework.
- It runs the application using the MapReduce algorithm, where data is processed in parallel on different CPU nodes. 
    - In other words, the Hadoop framework is capable enough to develop applications, which are further capable of running on clusters of computers and they could perform a complete statistical analysis for a huge amount of data.
- The core of Hadoop consists of: 
    - <strong>Storage</strong>
        - Known as <strong>Hadoop Distributed File System</strong> 
    - <strong>Processing</strong> 
        - Known as the <strong>MapReduce programming model</strong>. 
- Hadoop basically split files into the large blocks and distribute them across the clusters, transfer package code into nodes to process data in parallel.
- This approach dataset to be processed faster and more efficiently. 
- Other Hadoop modules are: 
    - <strong>Hadoop common</strong>, which is a bunch of Java libraries and utilities returned by Hadoop modules. 
        - These libraries provide a file system and operating system level abstraction, also contain required Java files and scripts to start Hadoop. 
    - <strong>Hadoop Yarn</strong> is also a module, which is being used for job scheduling and cluster resource management.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="spark">Spark</h4>
<p><strong>Spark is an open-source cluster computing designed for fast computation.</strong> 
- It provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. 
- The main feature of Spark is in-memory cluster computing that increases the speed of an application.
- Spark was built on the top of Hadoop MapReduce module and it extends the MapReduce model to efficiently use more type of computations which include Interactive Queries and Stream Processing. 
- Spark was introduced by the Apache software foundation, to speed up the Hadoop computational computing software process.
- Spark has its own cluster management and is not a modified version of Hadoop. 
- Spark utilizes Hadoop in two ways: 
    1. storage 
    2. processing. 
- Since cluster management is arriving from Spark itself, it uses Hadoop for storage purposes only.
- Spark is one of the Hadoop’s subprojects which was developed in 2009, and later it became open source under a BSD license. 
- It has lots of wonderful features, by modifying certain modules and incorporating new modules. 
- It helps run an application in a Hadoop cluster, multiple times faster in memory.
- This is made possible by reducing the number of read/write operations to disk. 
    - It stores the intermediate processing data in memory, saving read/write operations. 
- Spark also provides built-in APIs in Java, Python or Scala. 
    - Thus, one can write applications in multiple ways.
- Spark not only provides a Map and Reduce strategy but also support SQL queries, Streaming data, Machine learning and Graph Algorithms.</p>

<h2 id="comparison">Comparison</h2>
<h4 id="key-differences-between-hadoop-vs-spark">Key differences between Hadoop vs Spark</h4>
<ul>
<li>Both Hadoop vs Spark are popular choices in the market; </li>
<li>let us discuss some of the major Difference Between Hadoop and Spark:<ol>
<li>Hadoop is an open source framework which uses a MapReduce algorithm <ul>
<li>Spark is lightning fast cluster computing technology, which extends the MapReduce model to efficiently use with more type of computations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hadoop’s MapReduce model reads and writes from a disk, thus slow down the processing speed <ul>
<li>Spark reduces the number of read/write cycles to disk and store intermediate data in-memory, hence faster-processing speed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hadoop requires developers to hand code each and every operation <ul>
<li>Spark is easy to program with RDD – Resilient Distributed Dataset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hadoop MapReduce model provides a batch engine, hence dependent on different engines for other requirements <ul>
<li>Spark performs batch, interactive, Machine Learning and Streaming all in the same cluster.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hadoop is designed to handle batch processing efficiently <ul>
<li>Spark is designed to handle real-time data efficiently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hadoop is a high latency computing framework, which does not have an interactive mode <ul>
<li>Spark is a low latency computing and can process data interactively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With Hadoop MapReduce, a developer can only process data in batch mode only <ul>
<li>Spark can process real-time data through Spark Streaming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hadoop is designed to handle faults and failures, it is naturally resilient toward faults, hence a highly fault-tolerant system <ul>
<li>with Spark, RDD allows recovery of partitions on failed nodes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hadoop needs an external job scheduler for example – Oozie to schedule complex flows <ul>
<li>Spark has in-memory computation, so it has its own flow scheduler.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hadoop is a cheaper option available while comparing it in terms of cost <ul>
<li>Spark requires a lot of RAM to run in-memory, thus increasing the cluster and hence cost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
