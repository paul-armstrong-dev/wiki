### Sorts

- Comparison sorts‎ (30 P)
    - A comparison sort is a particular type of sorting algorithm which can only read the list elements through a single abstract comparison operation (often a "less than" operator) that determines which of two elements should occur first in the final sorted list.

- Online sorts‎ (6 P)
- These sorts can start sorting their input without having received all of it, and are therefore classified as online algorithms.
- Selection algorithms‎ (7 P)
    - In computer science, a selection algorithm is an algorithm for finding the kth smallest number in a list or array; such a number is called the kth order statistic. This includes the cases of finding the minimum, maximum, and median elements. There are O(n)-time (worst-case linear time) selection algorithms, and sublinear performance is possible for structured data; in the extreme, O(1) for an array of sorted data. Selection is a subproblem of more complex problems like the nearest neighbor and shortest path problems. Many selection algorithms are derived by generalizing a sorting algorithm, and conversely some sorting algorithms can be derived as repeated application of selection.
